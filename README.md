# Golf_Analytics_Sample_Task

This task takes in data from a text file, performs a simple regression using a few columns with Score as the dependent variable, and performs a Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the probability that the sum of four random scores is less than or equal to a given threshold (270 in this case).
